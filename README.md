#Game-Brick-Breaker

##Description

Brickbreaker is an engaging arcade game that players can enjoy on their browser. The objective is to control a paddle and use it to bounce a ball to break a series of bricks arranged at the top of the screen. 
Each brick destroyed scores points, and the game continues until all bricks are cleared or the ball falls below the paddle. 
This game features 4 levels, each increasing the number of bricks and adding to the challenge as players progress.
